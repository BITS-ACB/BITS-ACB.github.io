ACB is for the  American Council of the Blind. BITS is an affiliate of ACB. Click through any of these links to learn more about BITS, ACB, and how they're related.</p>"},{"location":"about/#about-the-bits-acb-organization-on-github","title":"About the BITS-ACB Organization on github","text":"<p>In the interest of growing participation in BITS, It was decided to create somewhat formal learning opportunities. The first of these was a Python programming course starting in early 2024. The BITS-ACB organization was created on github to support that effort.</p>"},{"location":"about/#about-this-documentation","title":"About this Documentation","text":"<p>As of February, 2024, we're using github pages as the documentation site for the BITS-ACB organization. The docs are written in markdown and converted to HTML using  mkdocs with the material theme. Github pages works slightly differently for project repos than for personal account or organization github pages. For details, see this article on deploying mkdocs to github pages. The documentation repo structure will make more sense if you read that article (it's not too long).</p>"},{"location":"about/#where-is-the-the-documentation","title":"Where is the the Documentation","text":"<p>There are two repos you'll need to clone if you want to work with the docs:</p> <pre><code>git@github.com:BITS-ACB/bits-acb.gh-pages.git\n</code></pre> <pre><code>git@github.com:BITS-ACB/bits-acb.github.io.git\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>bits-acb.gh-pages</code> repo has all the markdown and any other associated files used to generate the HTML. The <code>bits-acb.github.io</code> repo is there because that's how github pages works for personal and organization accounts.</p>"},{"location":"about/#updating-and-building-the-documentation","title":"Updating and Building the Documentation","text":"<p>First, you need Python. I've been using 3.11 but I think mkdocs will work with 3.9, maybe 3.10 (check the mkdocs-material docs). The only additional Python package you should need to install is:</p> <pre><code>pip install mkdocs-material\n</code></pre> <p>To edit and deploy changes, you need to clone both repos listed above. It's best to keep them in the same parent directory, there's a command below making that assumption. For example:</p> <pre><code>~/bits-acb-work/\n    bits-acb.gh-pages/\n    bits-acb.github.io/\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>bits-acb.gh-pages</code> repo is the only one you should edit.</p> <p>Anyone is welcome to edit existing documentation for corrections and/or clarification. If you want to add new topics, please follow the existing structure for where to add.</p> <p>For details on how mkdocs and the material theme work, see the links above. For the most part, you'll only need to work with markdown, which is fairly standard. If you're adding new content, you'll need to add the file to the mkdocs.yml file in the root of the <code>bits-acb.gh-pages</code> repo.</p>"},{"location":"about/#checking-your-work","title":"Checking Your Work","text":"<p>Once you've made changes in the <code>bits-acb.gh-pages</code> repo,  you can build and view those changes locally. In the root of the repo, where the mkdocs.yml file lives, run:</p> <pre><code>mkdocs serve \n</code></pre> <p>Mkdocs will build the site and start a simple web server to give you local access to the documentation. If the build went well, you should see your local copy of the docs, with your changes at: http://localhost:8000.</p> <p>You can keep this server running while you make changes to your local copy of the docs. Your changes will be reflected automatically in the browser.</p>"},{"location":"about/#deploy-your-changes-to-github-pages","title":"Deploy Your Changes to Github Pages","text":"<ol> <li>Commit and push your changes in <code>bits-acb.gh-pages</code> to the main branch on github.</li> <li>In the root directory of the <code>bits-acb.github.io</code> repo, run the following command:</li> </ol> <pre><code>mkdocs gh-deploy --config-file ../bits-acb.gh-pages/mkdocs.yml  --remote-branch main \n</code></pre> <p>If all went well, you should see your changes at: https://bits-acb.github.io (it might take a few minutes depending on how busy github is).</p>"},{"location":"courses/","title":"Welcome to BITS ACB Course Information","text":""},{"location":"courses/intro_python_course/","title":"Welcome to the Introduction to Python Course","text":""},{"location":"resources/","title":"List of Resources","text":""},{"location":"resources/using_cli/","title":"Notes for using a Command Line","text":""},{"location":"resources/using_git/","title":"Notes for Git","text":""},{"location":"resources/using_vscode/","title":"Notes for Visual Studio Code (VSCode)","text":""}]}
